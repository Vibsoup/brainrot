            <h2>Black Solo Polyamorous Hijabi Amputee</h2>
            <p>The Black Solo Polyamorous Hijabi Amputee meme shows a digital drawing of the person described by the title next to a “solo poly” explainer. An Instagram user created and posted the graphic in 2020 for educational purposes, but it was repurposed as a meme in 2024 during a surge in anti-“woke” and anti-DEI sentiments in the U.S. <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/memes/black-solo-polyamorous-hijabi-amputee/" target="_blank">Solo Poly.</a></p>

            <h2>Queen Never Cry</h2>
            <p>The 'Queen Never Cry' or 'Queen Don’t Cry' meme originates from the Korean webcomic The Ki Sisters. In a scene from Chapter 34, a mother whispers 'Queen never cry' to her newborn baby. The baby, initially crying, stops immediately, crosses her arms, and adopts a composed expression, leaving the medical staff stunned. <a href="https://x.com/p3ace_d3fender/status/1860407153669902717" target="_blank">Diva.</a></p>

            <h2>Holding space for defying gravity</h2>
            <p>During her interview with the Wicked stars, queer media’s star of the hour, Tracy E. Gilchrist, a journalist from Out, made a comment that was so very online, so very therapy-speak, and so very 2024 that it has since shaken the world: “This week, people are taking the lyrics to ‘Defying Gravity’ and really holding space with that and feeling power in that,” Gilchrist said—with the sort of quiet solemnity befitting such a groundbreaking statement. <a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/what-does-holding-space-for-defying-gravity-mean-really-the-viral-meme-explained" target="_blank">Queer Media.</a></p>

            <h2>Gypsy</h2>
            <p>The Gypsy Rose Blanchard "Panini Pressed" Video, also known as the "I Have a Chad" Video, is a viral video posted to Gypsy Rose Blanchard's TikTok Story in June 2024 in which she addresses TikToker <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc3xXu9E0EgD16blftkZWxg" target="_blank">@flawlessnina</a> (Flawless Nina) after she accused Blanchard's boyfriend Ken Urker of being a homewrecker and using Blanchard for money. Nina's videos purportedly inspired Urker to call Nina "obsessed" with their relationship on TikTok LIVE, followed by Nina claiming Urker wants to be with her, resulting in Blanchard's response video. In the video, Blanchard says she's "so not threatened" by Nina, that her man "wouldn't touch" her "with a 10-foot pole." <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/gypsy-rose-blanchard-panini-pressed-video-response-to-flawless-nina" target="_blank">Fresh press.</a></p>
